## Features
On the main page I implemented bootstrap carousel featuring popular books. This information was scraped from blog on GoodReads.
Also I've implemented sign in and sign up methods.

I integrated Google books api for book search. List of results is shown after processing JSON response.

After selecting a book, a request is sent for fetching reviews from Goodreads using Selenium framework.
I created a form where users can schedule new meetings.

For meeting in person address is required. I integrated Yelp API to help search for a place.

I implemented a Video Recorder using the MediaStream API for creating video notes.
Before submission video is available for review or re-recording.

Different react components on the main page are interconnected and display meetings that users can join, drop from or cancel if already created.
They are dynamically updated upon receiving JSON success response from server.
I implemented security methods to ensure that users wonâ€™t join same meetings twice.

Video note is also available for streaming here.


Notifications are displayed on top of the screen. 
Each message is independent and has its own timer set for 15sec.
